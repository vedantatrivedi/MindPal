"""
The IBM Watson&trade; Text to Speech service provides APIs that use IBM's speech-synthesis
capabilities to synthesize text into natural-sounding speech in a variety of languages,
dialects, and voices. The service supports at least one male or female voice, sometimes
both, for each language. The audio is streamed back to the client with minimal delay.
For speech synthesis, the service supports a synchronous HTTP Representational State
Transfer (REST) interface and a WebSocket interface. Both interfaces support plain text
and SSML input. SSML is an XML-based markup language that provides text annotation for
speech-synthesis applications. The WebSocket interface also supports the SSML
<code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> element and word timings.
The service offers a customization interface that you can use to define sounds-like or
phonetic translations for words. A sounds-like translation consists of one or more words
that, when combined, sound like the word. A phonetic translation is based on the SSML
phoneme format for representing a word. You can specify a phonetic translation in standard
International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) representation or in the proprietary IBM Symbolic
Phonetic Representation (SPR).
The service also offers a Tune by Example feature that lets you define custom prompts. You
can also define speaker models to improve the quality of your custom prompts. The service
support custom prompts only for US English custom models and voices.
**IBM Cloud&reg;.** The Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, Australian English, and Korean languages
and voices are supported only for IBM Cloud. For phonetic translation, they support only
IPA, not SPR.

        * The Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, Australian English, and Korean voices are now neural
        instead of concatenative.
        * The `ar-AR_OmarVoice` voice is deprecated. Use `ar-MS_OmarVoice` voice instead.
        * The `ar-AR` language identifier cannot be used to create a custom model. Use the
        `ar-MS` identifier instead.
        * The standard concatenative voices for the following languages are now
        deprecated: Brazilian Portuguese, United Kingdom and United States English,
        French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish (all dialects).
        * The features expressive SSML, voice transformation SSML, and use of the `volume`
        attribute of the `<prosody>` element are deprecated and are not supported with any
        of the service's neural voices.
        * All of the service's voices are now customizable and generally available (GA)
        for production use.
        The deprecated voices and features will continue to function for at least one year
        but might be removed at a future date. You are encouraged to migrate to the
        equivalent neural voices at your earliest convenience. For more information about

        Synthesize audio.

        Synthesizes text to audio that is spoken in the specified voice. The service bases
        its understanding of the language for the input text on the specified voice. Use a
        voice that matches the language of the input text.
        The method accepts a maximum of 5 KB of input text in the body of the request, and
        8 KB for the URL and headers. The 5 KB limit includes any SSML tags that you
        specify. The service returns the synthesized audio stream as an array of bytes.
        **See also:** [The HTTP
        interface](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-usingHTTP#usingHTTP).
        ### Audio formats (accept types)
         The service can return audio in the following formats (MIME types).
        * Where indicated, you can optionally specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the
        audio. You must specify a sampling rate for the `audio/l16` and `audio/mulaw`
        formats. A specified sampling rate must lie in the range of 8 kHz to 192 kHz. Some
        formats restrict the sampling rate to certain values, as noted.
        * For the `audio/l16` format, you can optionally specify the endianness
        (`endianness`) of the audio: `endianness=big-endian` or
        `endianness=little-endian`.
        Use the `Accept` header or the `accept` parameter to specify the requested format
        of the response audio. If you omit an audio format altogether, the service returns
        the audio in Ogg format with the Opus codec (`audio/ogg;codecs=opus`). The service
        always returns single-channel audio.
        * `audio/basic` - The service returns audio with a sampling rate of 8000 Hz.
        * `audio/flac` - You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default
        sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.
        * `audio/l16` - You must specify the `rate` of the audio. You can optionally
        specify the `endianness` of the audio. The default endianness is `little-endian`.
        * `audio/mp3` - You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default
        sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.
        * `audio/mpeg` - You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default
        sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.
        * `audio/mulaw` - You must specify the `rate` of the audio.
        * `audio/ogg` - The service returns the audio in the `vorbis` codec. You can
        optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is 22,050
        Hz.
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus` - You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio.
        Only the following values are valid sampling rates: `48000`, `24000`, `16000`,
        `12000`, or `8000`. If you specify a value other than one of these, the service
        returns an error. The default sampling rate is 48,000 Hz.
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis` - You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio.
        The default sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.
        * `audio/wav` - You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default
        sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.
        * `audio/webm` - The service returns the audio in the `opus` codec. The service
        returns audio with a sampling rate of 48,000 Hz.
        * `audio/webm;codecs=opus` - The service returns audio with a sampling rate of
        48,000 Hz.
        * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis` - You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio.
        The default sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.
        For more information about specifying an audio format, including additional
        details about some of the formats, see [Using audio
        formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-audio-formats).
        ### Important voice updates for IBM Cloud
         The service's voices underwent significant change on 2 December 2020.

        ### Warning messages
         If a request includes invalid query parameters, the service returns a `Warnings`
        response header that provides messages about the invalid parameters. The warning
        includes a descriptive message and a list of invalid argument strings. For
        example, a message such as `"Unknown arguments:"` or `"Unknown url query
        arguments:"` followed by a list of the form `"{invalid_arg_1}, {invalid_arg_2}."`
        The request succeeds despite the warnings.

        :param str text: The text to synthesize.
        :param str accept: (optional) The requested format (MIME type) of the
               audio. You can use the `Accept` header or the `accept` parameter to specify
               the audio format. For more information about specifying an audio format,
               see **Audio formats (accept types)** in the method description.
        :param str voice: (optional) The voice to use for synthesis. For more

        ### Important voice updates for IBM Cloud
         The service's voices underwent significant change on 2 December 2020.
        * The Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, Australian English, and Korean voices are now neural
        instead of concatenative.
        * The `ar-AR_OmarVoice` voice is deprecated. Use `ar-MS_OmarVoice` voice instead.
        * The `ar-AR` language identifier cannot be used to create a custom model. Use the
        `ar-MS` identifier instead.
        * The standard concatenative voices for the following languages are now
        deprecated: Brazilian Portuguese, United Kingdom and United States English,
        French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish (all dialects).
        * The features expressive SSML, voice transformation SSML, and use of the `volume`
        attribute of the `<prosody>` element are deprecated and are not supported with any
        of the service's neural voices.
        * All of the service's voices are now customizable and generally available (GA)
        for production use.
        The deprecated voices and features will continue to function for at least one year
        but might be removed at a future date. You are encouraged to migrate to the
        equivalent neural voices at your earliest convenience. For more information about
        all voice updates, see the [2 December 2020 service
        update](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-release-notes#December2020)

        """
        Add a custom prompt.

        Adds a custom prompt to a custom model. A prompt is defined by the text that is to
        be spoken, the audio for that text, a unique user-specified ID for the prompt, and
        an optional speaker ID. The information is used to generate prosodic data that is
        not visible to the user. This data is used by the service to produce the
        synthesized audio upon request. You must use credentials for the instance of the
        service that owns a custom model to add a prompt to it. You can add a maximum of
        1000 custom prompts to a single custom model.
        You are recommended to assign meaningful values for prompt IDs. For example, use
        `goodbye` to identify a prompt that speaks a farewell message. Prompt IDs must be
        unique within a given custom model. You cannot define two prompts with the same
        name for the same custom model. If you provide the ID of an existing prompt, the
        previously uploaded prompt is replaced by the new information. The existing prompt
        is reprocessed by using the new text and audio and, if provided, new speaker
        model, and the prosody data associated with the prompt is updated.
        The quality of a prompt is undefined if the language of a prompt does not match
        the language of its custom model. This is consistent with any text or SSML that is
        specified for a speech synthesis request. The service makes a best-effort attempt
        to render the specified text for the prompt; it does not validate that the
        language of the text matches the language of the model.
        Adding a prompt is an asynchronous operation. Although it accepts less audio than
        speaker enrollment, the service must align the audio with the provided text. The
        time that it takes to process a prompt depends on the prompt itself. The
        processing time for a reasonably sized prompt generally matches the length of the
        audio (for example, it takes 20 seconds to process a 20-second prompt).
        For shorter prompts, you can wait for a reasonable amount of time and then check
        the status of the prompt with the [Get a custom prompt](#getcustomprompt) method.
        For longer prompts, consider using that method to poll the service every few
        seconds to determine when the prompt becomes available. No prompt can be used for
        speech synthesis if it is in the `processing` or `failed` state. Only prompts that
        are in the `available` state can be used for speech synthesis.
        When it processes a request, the service attempts to align the text and the audio
        that are provided for the prompt. The text that is passed with a prompt must match
        the spoken audio as closely as possible. Optimally, the text and audio match
        exactly. The service does its best to align the specified text with the audio, and
        it can often compensate for mismatches between the two. But if the service cannot
        effectively align the text and the audio, possibly because the magnitude of
        mismatches between the two is too great, processing of the prompt fails.
        ### Evaluating a prompt
         Always listen to and evaluate a prompt to determine its quality before using it
        in production. To evaluate a prompt, include only the single prompt in a speech
        synthesis request by using the following SSML extension, in this case for a prompt
        whose ID is `goodbye`:
        `<ibm:prompt id="goodbye"/>`
        In some cases, you might need to rerecord and resubmit a prompt as many as five
        times to address the following possible problems:
        * The service might fail to detect a mismatch between the prompt’s text and audio.
        The longer the prompt, the greater the chance for misalignment between its text
        and audio. Therefore, multiple shorter prompts are preferable to a single long
        prompt.
        * The text of a prompt might include a word that the service does not recognize.
        In this case, you can create a custom word and pronunciation pair to tell the
        service how to pronounce the word. You must then re-create the prompt.
        * The quality of the input audio might be insufficient or the service’s processing
        of the audio might fail to detect the intended prosody. Submitting new audio for
        the prompt can correct these issues.
        If a prompt that is created without a speaker ID does not adequately reflect the
        intended prosody, enrolling the speaker and providing a speaker ID for the prompt
        is one recommended means of potentially improving the quality of the prompt. This
        is especially important for shorter prompts such as "good-bye" or "thank you,"
        where less audio data makes it more difficult to match the prosody of the speaker.
        Custom prompts are supported only for use with US English custom models and
        voices.

        Create a speaker model.

        Creates a new speaker model, which is an optional enrollment token for users who
        are to add prompts to custom models. A speaker model contains information about a
        user's voice. The service extracts this information from a WAV audio sample that
        you pass as the body of the request. Associating a speaker model with a prompt is
        optional, but the information that is extracted from the speaker model helps the
        service learn about the speaker's voice.
        A speaker model can make an appreciable difference in the quality of prompts,
        especially short prompts with relatively little audio, that are associated with
        that speaker. A speaker model can help the service produce a prompt with more
        confidence; the lack of a speaker model can potentially compromise the quality of
        a prompt.
        The gender of the speaker who creates a speaker model does not need to match the
        gender of a voice that is used with prompts that are associated with that speaker
        model. For example, a speaker model that is created by a male speaker can be
        associated with prompts that are spoken by female voices.
        You create a speaker model for a given instance of the service. The new speaker
        model is owned by the service instance whose credentials are used to create it.
        That same speaker can then be used to create prompts for all custom models within
        that service instance. No language is associated with a speaker model, but each
        custom model has a single specified language. You can add prompts only to US
        English models.
        You specify a name for the speaker when you create it. The name must be unique
        among all speaker names for the owning service instance. To re-create a speaker
        model for an existing speaker name, you must first delete the existing speaker
        model that has that name.
        Speaker enrollment is a synchronous operation. Although it accepts more audio data
        than a prompt, the process of adding a speaker is very fast. The service simply
        extracts information about the speaker’s voice from the audio. Unlike prompts,
        speaker models neither need nor accept a transcription of the audio. When the call
        returns, the audio is fully processed and the speaker enrollment is complete.
        The service returns a speaker ID with the request. A speaker ID is globally unique
        identifier (GUID) that you use to identify the speaker in subsequent requests to
        the service. Speaker models and the custom prompts with which they are used are
        supported only for use with US English custom models and voices.

        deletes all data for the customer ID, regardless of the method by which the
        information was added. The method has no effect if no data is associated with the
        customer ID. You must issue the request with credentials for the same instance of
        the service that was used to associate the customer ID with the data. You
        associate a customer ID with data by passing the `X-Watson-Metadata` header with a
        request that passes the data.
        **Note:** If you delete an instance of the service from the service console, all
        data associated with that service instance is automatically deleted. This includes
        all custom models and word/translation pairs, and all data related to speech
        synthesis requests.
