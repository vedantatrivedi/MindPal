"""
The IBM Watson&trade; Speech to Text service provides APIs that use IBM's
speech-recognition capabilities to produce transcripts of spoken audio. The service can
transcribe speech from various languages and audio formats. In addition to basic
transcription, the service can produce detailed information about many different aspects
of the audio. It returns all JSON response content in the UTF-8 character set.
The service supports two types of models: previous-generation models that include the
terms `Broadband` and `Narrowband` in their names, and next-generation models that include
the terms `Multimedia` and `Telephony` in their names. Broadband and multimedia models
have minimum sampling rates of 16 kHz. Narrowband and telephony models have minimum
sampling rates of 8 kHz. The next-generation models offer high throughput and greater
transcription accuracy.
For speech recognition, the service supports synchronous and asynchronous HTTP
Representational State Transfer (REST) interfaces. It also supports a WebSocket interface
that provides a full-duplex, low-latency communication channel: Clients send requests and
audio to the service and receive results over a single connection asynchronously.
The service also offers two customization interfaces. Use language model customization to
expand the vocabulary of a base model with domain-specific terminology. Use acoustic model
customization to adapt a base model for the acoustic characteristics of your audio. For
language model customization, the service also supports grammars. A grammar is a formal
language specification that lets you restrict the phrases that the service can recognize.
Language model customization is available for most previous- and next-generation models.
Acoustic model customization is available for all previous-generation models. Grammars are
beta functionality that is available for all previous-generation models that support
language model customization.

        Recognize audio.

        Sends audio and returns transcription results for a recognition request. You can
        pass a maximum of 100 MB and a minimum of 100 bytes of audio with a request. The
        service automatically detects the endianness of the incoming audio and, for audio
        that includes multiple channels, downmixes the audio to one-channel mono during
        transcoding. The method returns only final results; to enable interim results, use
        the WebSocket API. (With the `curl` command, use the `--data-binary` option to
        upload the file for the request.)
        **See also:** [Making a basic HTTP
        request](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-http#HTTP-basic).
        ### Streaming mode
         For requests to transcribe live audio as it becomes available, you must set the
        `Transfer-Encoding` header to `chunked` to use streaming mode. In streaming mode,
        the service closes the connection (status code 408) if it does not receive at
        least 15 seconds of audio (including silence) in any 30-second period. The service
        also closes the connection (status code 400) if it detects no speech for
        `inactivity_timeout` seconds of streaming audio; use the `inactivity_timeout`
        parameter to change the default of 30 seconds.
        **See also:**
        * [Audio
        transmission](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#transmission)
        *
        [Timeouts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#timeouts)
        ### Audio formats (content types)
         The service accepts audio in the following formats (MIME types).
        * For formats that are labeled **Required**, you must use the `Content-Type`
        header with the request to specify the format of the audio.
        * For all other formats, you can omit the `Content-Type` header or specify
        `application/octet-stream` with the header to have the service automatically
        detect the format of the audio. (With the `curl` command, you can specify either
        `"Content-Type:"` or `"Content-Type: application/octet-stream"`.)
        Where indicated, the format that you specify must include the sampling rate and
        can optionally include the number of channels and the endianness of the audio.
        * `audio/alaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/basic` (**Required.** Use only with narrowband models.)
        * `audio/flac`
        * `audio/g729` (Use only with narrowband models.)
        * `audio/l16` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the
        number of channels (`channels`) and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/mp3`
        * `audio/mpeg`
        * `audio/mulaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
        * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
        * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
        The sampling rate of the audio must match the sampling rate of the model for the
        recognition request: for broadband models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband models,
        at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is higher than the minimum
        required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate. If the
        sampling rate of the audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the request
        fails.
         **See also:** [Supported audio
        formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-audio-formats).
        ### Next-generation models
         The service supports next-generation `Multimedia` (16 kHz) and `Telephony` (8
        kHz) models for many languages. Next-generation models have higher throughput than
        the service's previous generation of `Broadband` and `Narrowband` models. When you
        use next-generation models, the service can return transcriptions more quickly and
        also provide noticeably better transcription accuracy.
        You specify a next-generation model by using the `model` query parameter, as you
        do a previous-generation model. Many next-generation models also support the
        `low_latency` parameter, which is not available with previous-generation models.
        But next-generation models do not support all of the parameters that are available
        for use with previous-generation models. For more information about all parameters
        that are supported for use with next-generation models, see [Supported features
        for next-generation
        models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-models-ng#models-ng-features).
        **See also:** [Next-generation languages and
        models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-models-ng).
        ### Multipart speech recognition
         **Note:** The Watson SDKs do not support multipart speech recognition.
        The HTTP `POST` method of the service also supports multipart speech recognition.
        With multipart requests, you pass all audio data as multipart form data. You
        specify some parameters as request headers and query parameters, but you pass JSON
        metadata as form data to control most aspects of the transcription. You can use
        multipart recognition to pass multiple audio files with a single request.
        Use the multipart approach with browsers for which JavaScript is disabled or when
        the parameters used with the request are greater than the 8 KB limit imposed by
        most HTTP servers and proxies. You can encounter this limit, for example, if you
        want to spot a very large number of keywords.
        **See also:** [Making a multipart HTTP
        request](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-http#HTTP-multi).

        :param BinaryIO audio: The audio to transcribe.
        :param str content_type: (optional) The format (MIME type) of the audio.
               For more information about specifying an audio format, see **Audio formats
               (content types)** in the method description.
        :param str model: (optional) The identifier of the model that is to be used
               for the recognition request. (**Note:** The model `ar-AR_BroadbandModel` is
               deprecated; use `ar-MS_BroadbandModel` instead.) See [Previous-generation
               languages and
               models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-models)
               and [Next-generation languages and
               models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-models-ng).
        :param str language_customization_id: (optional) The customization ID
               (GUID) of a custom language model that is to be used with the recognition
               request. The base model of the specified custom language model must match
               the model specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request
               with credentials for the instance of the service that owns the custom
               model. By default, no custom language model is used. See [Using a custom
               language model for speech
               recognition](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-languageUse).
               **Note:** Use this parameter instead of the deprecated `customization_id`
               parameter.
        :param str acoustic_customization_id: (optional) The customization ID
               (GUID) of a custom acoustic model that is to be used with the recognition
               request. The base model of the specified custom acoustic model must match
               the model specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request
               with credentials for the instance of the service that owns the custom
               model. By default, no custom acoustic model is used. See [Using a custom
               acoustic model for speech
               recognition](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-acousticUse).
        :param str base_model_version: (optional) The version of the specified base
               model that is to be used with the recognition request. Multiple versions of
               a base model can exist when a model is updated for internal improvements.
               The parameter is intended primarily for use with custom models that have
               been upgraded for a new base model. The default value depends on whether
               the parameter is used with or without a custom model. See [Making speech
               recognition requests with upgraded custom
               models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-custom-upgrade-use#custom-upgrade-use-recognition).
        :param float customization_weight: (optional) If you specify the
               customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model with the recognition
               request, the customization weight tells the service how much weight to give
               to words from the custom language model compared to those from the base
               model for the current request.
               Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization
               weight was specified for the custom model when it was trained, the default
               value is 0.3. A customization weight that you specify overrides a weight
               that was specified when the custom model was trained.
               The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher
               value if your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model.
               Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the
               accuracy of phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively
               affect performance on non-domain phrases.
               See [Using customization
               weight](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-languageUse#weight).
        :param int inactivity_timeout: (optional) The time in seconds after which,
               if only silence (no speech) is detected in streaming audio, the connection
               is closed with a 400 error. The parameter is useful for stopping audio
               submission from a live microphone when a user simply walks away. Use `-1`
               for infinity. See [Inactivity
               timeout](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#timeouts-inactivity).
        :param List[str] keywords: (optional) An array of keyword strings to spot
               in the audio. Each keyword string can include one or more string tokens.
               Keywords are spotted only in the final results, not in interim hypotheses.
               If you specify any keywords, you must also specify a keywords threshold.
               Omit the parameter or specify an empty array if you do not need to spot
               keywords.
               You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords with a single request. A single
               keyword can have a maximum length of 1024 characters, though the maximum
               effective length for double-byte languages might be shorter. Keywords are
               case-insensitive.
               See [Keyword
               spotting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-spotting#keyword-spotting).
        :param float keywords_threshold: (optional) A confidence value that is the
               lower bound for spotting a keyword. A word is considered to match a keyword
               if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a
               probability between 0.0 and 1.0. If you specify a threshold, you must also
               specify one or more keywords. The service performs no keyword spotting if
               you omit either parameter. See [Keyword
               spotting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-spotting#keyword-spotting).
        :param int max_alternatives: (optional) The maximum number of alternative
               transcripts that the service is to return. By default, the service returns
               a single transcript. If you specify a value of `0`, the service uses the
               default value, `1`. See [Maximum
               alternatives](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-metadata#max-alternatives).
        :param float word_alternatives_threshold: (optional) A confidence value
               that is the lower bound for identifying a hypothesis as a possible word
               alternative (also known as "Confusion Networks"). An alternative word is
               considered if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold.
               Specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0. By default, the service computes
               no alternative words. See [Word
               alternatives](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-spotting#word-alternatives).
        :param bool word_confidence: (optional) If `true`, the service returns a
               confidence measure in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 for each word. By default,
               the service returns no word confidence scores. See [Word
               confidence](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-metadata#word-confidence).
        :param bool timestamps: (optional) If `true`, the service returns time
               alignment for each word. By default, no timestamps are returned. See [Word
               timestamps](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-metadata#word-timestamps).
        :param bool profanity_filter: (optional) If `true`, the service filters
               profanity from all output except for keyword results by replacing
               inappropriate words with a series of asterisks. Set the parameter to
               `false` to return results with no censoring. Applies to US English and
               Japanese transcription only. See [Profanity
               filtering](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-formatting#profanity-filtering).
        :param bool smart_formatting: (optional) If `true`, the service converts
               dates, times, series of digits and numbers, phone numbers, currency values,
               and internet addresses into more readable, conventional representations in
               the final transcript of a recognition request. For US English, the service
               also converts certain keyword strings to punctuation symbols. By default,
               the service performs no smart formatting.
               **Beta:** The parameter is beta functionality. Applies to US English,
               Japanese, and Spanish transcription only.
               See [Smart
               formatting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-formatting#smart-formatting).
        :param bool speaker_labels: (optional) If `true`, the response includes
               labels that identify which words were spoken by which participants in a
               multi-person exchange. By default, the service returns no speaker labels.
               Setting `speaker_labels` to `true` forces the `timestamps` parameter to be
               `true`, regardless of whether you specify `false` for the parameter.
               **Beta:** The parameter is beta functionality.
               * For previous-generation models, the parameter can be used for Australian
               English, US English, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (both broadband
               and narrowband models) and UK English (narrowband model) transcription
               only.
               * For next-generation models, the parameter can be used for English
               (Australian, Indian, UK, and US), German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish
               transcription only.
               Restrictions and limitations apply to the use of speaker labels for both
               types of models. See [Speaker
               labels](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-speaker-labels).
        :param str customization_id: (optional) **Deprecated.** Use the
               `language_customization_id` parameter to specify the customization ID
               (GUID) of a custom language model that is to be used with the recognition
               request. Do not specify both parameters with a request.
        :param str grammar_name: (optional) The name of a grammar that is to be
               used with the recognition request. If you specify a grammar, you must also
               use the `language_customization_id` parameter to specify the name of the
               custom language model for which the grammar is defined. The service
               recognizes only strings that are recognized by the specified grammar; it
               does not recognize other custom words from the model's words resource.
               **Beta:** The parameter is beta functionality.
               See [Using a grammar for speech
               recognition](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-grammarUse).
        :param bool redaction: (optional) If `true`, the service redacts, or masks,
               numeric data from final transcripts. The feature redacts any number that
               has three or more consecutive digits by replacing each digit with an `X`
               character. It is intended to redact sensitive numeric data, such as credit
               card numbers. By default, the service performs no redaction.
               When you enable redaction, the service automatically enables smart
               formatting, regardless of whether you explicitly disable that feature. To
               ensure maximum security, the service also disables keyword spotting
               (ignores the `keywords` and `keywords_threshold` parameters) and returns
               only a single final transcript (forces the `max_alternatives` parameter to
               be `1`).
               **Beta:** The parameter is beta functionality. Applies to US English,
               Japanese, and Korean transcription only.
               See [Numeric
               redaction](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-formatting#numeric-redaction).
        :param bool audio_metrics: (optional) If `true`, requests detailed
               information about the signal characteristics of the input audio. The
               service returns audio metrics with the final transcription results. By
               default, the service returns no audio metrics.
               See [Audio
               metrics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-metrics#audio-metrics).
        :param float end_of_phrase_silence_time: (optional) If `true`, specifies
               the duration of the pause interval at which the service splits a transcript
               into multiple final results. If the service detects pauses or extended
               silence before it reaches the end of the audio stream, its response can
               include multiple final results. Silence indicates a point at which the
               speaker pauses between spoken words or phrases.
               Specify a value for the pause interval in the range of 0.0 to 120.0.
               * A value greater than 0 specifies the interval that the service is to use
               for speech recognition.
               * A value of 0 indicates that the service is to use the default interval.
               It is equivalent to omitting the parameter.
               The default pause interval for most languages is 0.8 seconds; the default
               for Chinese is 0.6 seconds.
               See [End of phrase silence
               time](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-parsing#silence-time).
        :param bool split_transcript_at_phrase_end: (optional) If `true`, directs
               the service to split the transcript into multiple final results based on
               semantic features of the input, for example, at the conclusion of
               meaningful phrases such as sentences. The service bases its understanding
               of semantic features on the base language model that you use with a
               request. Custom language models and grammars can also influence how and
               where the service splits a transcript. By default, the service splits
               transcripts based solely on the pause interval.
               See [Split transcript at phrase
               end](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-parsing#split-transcript).
        :param float speech_detector_sensitivity: (optional) The sensitivity of
               speech activity detection that the service is to perform. Use the parameter
               to suppress word insertions from music, coughing, and other non-speech
               events. The service biases the audio it passes for speech recognition by
               evaluating the input audio against prior models of speech and non-speech
               activity.
               Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0:
               * 0.0 suppresses all audio (no speech is transcribed).
               * 0.5 (the default) provides a reasonable compromise for the level of
               sensitivity.
               * 1.0 suppresses no audio (speech detection sensitivity is disabled).
               The values increase on a monotonic curve. See [Speech detector
               sensitivity](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-detection#detection-parameters-sensitivity).
        :param float background_audio_suppression: (optional) The level to which
               the service is to suppress background audio based on its volume to prevent
               it from being transcribed as speech. Use the parameter to suppress side
               conversations or background noise.
               Specify a value in the range of 0.0 to 1.0:
               * 0.0 (the default) provides no suppression (background audio suppression
               is disabled).
               * 0.5 provides a reasonable level of audio suppression for general usage.
               * 1.0 suppresses all audio (no audio is transcribed).
               The values increase on a monotonic curve. See [Background audio
               suppression](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-detection#detection-parameters-suppression).
        :param bool low_latency: (optional) If `true` for next-generation
               `Multimedia` and `Telephony` models that support low latency, directs the
               service to produce results even more quickly than it usually does.
               Next-generation models produce transcription results faster than
               previous-generation models. The `low_latency` parameter causes the models
               to produce results even more quickly, though the results might be less
               accurate when the parameter is used.
               The parameter is not available for previous-generation `Broadband` and
               `Narrowband` models. It is available only for some next-generation models.
               For a list of next-generation models that support low latency, see
               [Supported next-generation language
               models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-models-ng#models-ng-supported).
               * For more information about the `low_latency` parameter, see [Low
               latency](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-interim#low-latency).

        Register a callback.

        Registers a callback URL with the service for use with subsequent asynchronous
        recognition requests. The service attempts to register, or allowlist, the callback
        URL if it is not already registered by sending a `GET` request to the callback
        URL. The service passes a random alphanumeric challenge string via the
        `challenge_string` parameter of the request. The request includes an `Accept`
        header that specifies `text/plain` as the required response type.
        To be registered successfully, the callback URL must respond to the `GET` request
        from the service. The response must send status code 200 and must include the
        challenge string in its body. Set the `Content-Type` response header to
        `text/plain`. Upon receiving this response, the service responds to the original
        registration request with response code 201.
        The service sends only a single `GET` request to the callback URL. If the service
        does not receive a reply with a response code of 200 and a body that echoes the
        challenge string sent by the service within five seconds, it does not allowlist
        the URL; it instead sends status code 400 in response to the request to register a
        callback. If the requested callback URL is already allowlisted, the service
        responds to the initial registration request with response code 200.
        If you specify a user secret with the request, the service uses it as a key to
        calculate an HMAC-SHA1 signature of the challenge string in its response to the
        `POST` request. It sends this signature in the `X-Callback-Signature` header of
        its `GET` request to the URL during registration. It also uses the secret to
        calculate a signature over the payload of every callback notification that uses
        the URL. The signature provides authentication and data integrity for HTTP
        communications.
        After you successfully register a callback URL, you can use it with an indefinite
        number of recognition requests. You can register a maximum of 20 callback URLS in
        a one-hour span of time.

        :param str callback_url: An HTTP or HTTPS URL to which callback
               notifications are to be sent. To be allowlisted, the URL must successfully
               echo the challenge string during URL verification. During verification, the
               client can also check the signature that the service sends in the
               `X-Callback-Signature` header to verify the origin of the request.
        :param str user_secret: (optional) A user-specified string that the service
               uses to generate the HMAC-SHA1 signature that it sends via the
               `X-Callback-Signature` header. The service includes the header during URL
               verification and with every notification sent to the callback URL. It
               calculates the signature over the payload of the notification. If you omit
               the parameter, the service does not send the header.

        Create a job.

        Creates a job for a new asynchronous recognition request. The job is owned by the
        instance of the service whose credentials are used to create it. How you learn the
        status and results of a job depends on the parameters you include with the job
        creation request:
        * By callback notification: Include the `callback_url` parameter to specify a URL
        to which the service is to send callback notifications when the status of the job
        changes. Optionally, you can also include the `events` and `user_token` parameters
        to subscribe to specific events and to specify a string that is to be included
        with each notification for the job.
        * By polling the service: Omit the `callback_url`, `events`, and `user_token`
        parameters. You must then use the [Check jobs](#checkjobs) or [Check a
        job](#checkjob) methods to check the status of the job, using the latter to
        retrieve the results when the job is complete.
        The two approaches are not mutually exclusive. You can poll the service for job
        status or obtain results from the service manually even if you include a callback
        URL. In both cases, you can include the `results_ttl` parameter to specify how
        long the results are to remain available after the job is complete. Using the
        HTTPS [Check a job](#checkjob) method to retrieve results is more secure than
        receiving them via callback notification over HTTP because it provides
        confidentiality in addition to authentication and data integrity.
        The method supports the same basic parameters as other HTTP and WebSocket
        recognition requests. It also supports the following parameters specific to the
        asynchronous interface:
        * `callback_url`
        * `events`
        * `user_token`
        * `results_ttl`
        You can pass a maximum of 1 GB and a minimum of 100 bytes of audio with a request.
        The service automatically detects the endianness of the incoming audio and, for
        audio that includes multiple channels, downmixes the audio to one-channel mono
        during transcoding. The method returns only final results; to enable interim
        results, use the WebSocket API. (With the `curl` command, use the `--data-binary`
        option to upload the file for the request.)
        **See also:** [Creating a
        job](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-async#create).
        ### Streaming mode
         For requests to transcribe live audio as it becomes available, you must set the
        `Transfer-Encoding` header to `chunked` to use streaming mode. In streaming mode,
        the service closes the connection (status code 408) if it does not receive at
        least 15 seconds of audio (including silence) in any 30-second period. The service
        also closes the connection (status code 400) if it detects no speech for
        `inactivity_timeout` seconds of streaming audio; use the `inactivity_timeout`
        parameter to change the default of 30 seconds.
        **See also:**
        * [Audio
        transmission](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#transmission)
        *
        [Timeouts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#timeouts)
        ### Audio formats (content types)
         The service accepts audio in the following formats (MIME types).
        * For formats that are labeled **Required**, you must use the `Content-Type`
        header with the request to specify the format of the audio.
        * For all other formats, you can omit the `Content-Type` header or specify
        `application/octet-stream` with the header to have the service automatically
        detect the format of the audio. (With the `curl` command, you can specify either
        `"Content-Type:"` or `"Content-Type: application/octet-stream"`.)
        Where indicated, the format that you specify must include the sampling rate and
        can optionally include the number of channels and the endianness of the audio.
        * `audio/alaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/basic` (**Required.** Use only with narrowband models.)
        * `audio/flac`
        * `audio/g729` (Use only with narrowband models.)
        * `audio/l16` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the
        number of channels (`channels`) and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/mp3`
        * `audio/mpeg`
        * `audio/mulaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
        * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
        * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
        The sampling rate of the audio must match the sampling rate of the model for the
        recognition request: for broadband models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband models,
        at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is higher than the minimum
        required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate. If the
        sampling rate of the audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the request
        fails.
         **See also:** [Supported audio
        formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-audio-formats).
        ### Next-generation models
         The service supports next-generation `Multimedia` (16 kHz) and `Telephony` (8
        kHz) models for many languages. Next-generation models have higher throughput than
        the service's previous generation of `Broadband` and `Narrowband` models. When you
        use next-generation models, the service can return transcriptions more quickly and
        also provide noticeably better transcription accuracy.
        You specify a next-generation model by using the `model` query parameter, as you
        do a previous-generation model. Many next-generation models also support the
        `low_latency` parameter, which is not available with previous-generation models.
        But next-generation models do not support all of the parameters that are available
        for use with previous-generation models. For more information about all parameters
        that are supported for use with next-generation models, see [Supported features
        for next-generation
        models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-models-ng#models-ng-features).
        **See also:** [Next-generation languages and
        models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-models-ng).

        :param BinaryIO audio: The audio to transcribe.
        :param str content_type: (optional) The format (MIME type) of the audio.
               For more information about specifying an audio format, see **Audio formats
               (content types)** in the method description.
        :param str model: (optional) The identifier of the model that is to be used
               for the recognition request. (**Note:** The model `ar-AR_BroadbandModel` is
               deprecated; use `ar-MS_BroadbandModel` instead.) See [Previous-generation
               languages and
               models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-models)
               and [Next-generation languages and
               models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-models-ng).
        :param str callback_url: (optional) A URL to which callback notifications
               are to be sent. The URL must already be successfully allowlisted by using
               the [Register a callback](#registercallback) method. You can include the
               same callback URL with any number of job creation requests. Omit the
               parameter to poll the service for job completion and results.
               Use the `user_token` parameter to specify a unique user-specified string
               with each job to differentiate the callback notifications for the jobs.
        :param str events: (optional) If the job includes a callback URL, a
               comma-separated list of notification events to which to subscribe. Valid
               events are
               * `recognitions.started` generates a callback notification when the service
               begins to process the job.
               * `recognitions.completed` generates a callback notification when the job
               is complete. You must use the [Check a job](#checkjob) method to retrieve
               the results before they time out or are deleted.
               * `recognitions.completed_with_results` generates a callback notification
               when the job is complete. The notification includes the results of the
               request.
               * `recognitions.failed` generates a callback notification if the service
               experiences an error while processing the job.
               The `recognitions.completed` and `recognitions.completed_with_results`
               events are incompatible. You can specify only of the two events.
               If the job includes a callback URL, omit the parameter to subscribe to the
               default events: `recognitions.started`, `recognitions.completed`, and
               `recognitions.failed`. If the job does not include a callback URL, omit the
               parameter.
        :param str user_token: (optional) If the job includes a callback URL, a
               user-specified string that the service is to include with each callback
               notification for the job; the token allows the user to maintain an internal
               mapping between jobs and notification events. If the job does not include a
               callback URL, omit the parameter.
        :param int results_ttl: (optional) The number of minutes for which the
               results are to be available after the job has finished. If not delivered
               via a callback, the results must be retrieved within this time. Omit the
               parameter to use a time to live of one week. The parameter is valid with or
               without a callback URL.
        :param str language_customization_id: (optional) The customization ID
               (GUID) of a custom language model that is to be used with the recognition
               request. The base model of the specified custom language model must match
               the model specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request
               with credentials for the instance of the service that owns the custom
               model. By default, no custom language model is used. See [Using a custom
               language model for speech
               recognition](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-languageUse).
               **Note:** Use this parameter instead of the deprecated `customization_id`
               parameter.
        :param str acoustic_customization_id: (optional) The customization ID
               (GUID) of a custom acoustic model that is to be used with the recognition
               request. The base model of the specified custom acoustic model must match
               the model specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request
               with credentials for the instance of the service that owns the custom
               model. By default, no custom acoustic model is used. See [Using a custom
               acoustic model for speech
               recognition](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-acousticUse).
        :param str base_model_version: (optional) The version of the specified base
               model that is to be used with the recognition request. Multiple versions of
               a base model can exist when a model is updated for internal improvements.
               The parameter is intended primarily for use with custom models that have
               been upgraded for a new base model. The default value depends on whether
               the parameter is used with or without a custom model. See [Making speech
               recognition requests with upgraded custom
               models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-custom-upgrade-use#custom-upgrade-use-recognition).
        :param float customization_weight: (optional) If you specify the
               customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model with the recognition
               request, the customization weight tells the service how much weight to give
               to words from the custom language model compared to those from the base
               model for the current request.
               Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization
               weight was specified for the custom model when it was trained, the default
               value is 0.3. A customization weight that you specify overrides a weight
               that was specified when the custom model was trained.
               The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher
               value if your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model.
               Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the
               accuracy of phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively
               affect performance on non-domain phrases.
               See [Using customization
               weight](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-languageUse#weight).
        :param int inactivity_timeout: (optional) The time in seconds after which,
               if only silence (no speech) is detected in streaming audio, the connection
               is closed with a 400 error. The parameter is useful for stopping audio
               submission from a live microphone when a user simply walks away. Use `-1`
               for infinity. See [Inactivity
               timeout](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#timeouts-inactivity).
        :param List[str] keywords: (optional) An array of keyword strings to spot
               in the audio. Each keyword string can include one or more string tokens.
               Keywords are spotted only in the final results, not in interim hypotheses.
               If you specify any keywords, you must also specify a keywords threshold.
               Omit the parameter or specify an empty array if you do not need to spot
               keywords.
               You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords with a single request. A single
               keyword can have a maximum length of 1024 characters, though the maximum
               effective length for double-byte languages might be shorter. Keywords are
               case-insensitive.
               See [Keyword
               spotting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-spotting#keyword-spotting).
        :param float keywords_threshold: (optional) A confidence value that is the
               lower bound for spotting a keyword. A word is considered to match a keyword
               if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a
               probability between 0.0 and 1.0. If you specify a threshold, you must also
               specify one or more keywords. The service performs no keyword spotting if
               you omit either parameter. See [Keyword
               spotting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-spotting#keyword-spotting).
        :param int max_alternatives: (optional) The maximum number of alternative
               transcripts that the service is to return. By default, the service returns
               a single transcript. If you specify a value of `0`, the service uses the
               default value, `1`. See [Maximum
               alternatives](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-metadata#max-alternatives).
        :param float word_alternatives_threshold: (optional) A confidence value
               that is the lower bound for identifying a hypothesis as a possible word
               alternative (also known as "Confusion Networks"). An alternative word is
               considered if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold.
               Specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0. By default, the service computes
               no alternative words. See [Word
               alternatives](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-spotting#word-alternatives).
        :param bool word_confidence: (optional) If `true`, the service returns a
               confidence measure in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 for each word. By default,
               the service returns no word confidence scores. See [Word
               confidence](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-metadata#word-confidence).
        :param bool timestamps: (optional) If `true`, the service returns time
               alignment for each word. By default, no timestamps are returned. See [Word
               timestamps](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-metadata#word-timestamps).
        :param bool profanity_filter: (optional) If `true`, the service filters
               profanity from all output except for keyword results by replacing
               inappropriate words with a series of asterisks. Set the parameter to
               `false` to return results with no censoring. Applies to US English and
               Japanese transcription only. See [Profanity
               filtering](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-formatting#profanity-filtering).
        :param bool smart_formatting: (optional) If `true`, the service converts
               dates, times, series of digits and numbers, phone numbers, currency values,
               and internet addresses into more readable, conventional representations in
               the final transcript of a recognition request. For US English, the service
               also converts certain keyword strings to punctuation symbols. By default,
               the service performs no smart formatting.
               **Beta:** The parameter is beta functionality. Applies to US English,
               Japanese, and Spanish transcription only.
               See [Smart
               formatting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-formatting#smart-formatting).
        :param bool speaker_labels: (optional) If `true`, the response includes
               labels that identify which words were spoken by which participants in a
               multi-person exchange. By default, the service returns no speaker labels.
               Setting `speaker_labels` to `true` forces the `timestamps` parameter to be
               `true`, regardless of whether you specify `false` for the parameter.
               **Beta:** The parameter is beta functionality.
               * For previous-generation models, the parameter can be used for Australian
               English, US English, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (both broadband
               and narrowband models) and UK English (narrowband model) transcription
               only.
               * For next-generation models, the parameter can be used for English
               (Australian, Indian, UK, and US), German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish
               transcription only.
               Restrictions and limitations apply to the use of speaker labels for both
               types of models. See [Speaker
               labels](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-speaker-labels).
        :param str customization_id: (optional) **Deprecated.** Use the
               `language_customization_id` parameter to specify the customization ID
               (GUID) of a custom language model that is to be used with the recognition
               request. Do not specify both parameters with a request.
        :param str grammar_name: (optional) The name of a grammar that is to be
               used with the recognition request. If you specify a grammar, you must also
               use the `language_customization_id` parameter to specify the name of the
               custom language model for which the grammar is defined. The service
               recognizes only strings that are recognized by the specified grammar; it
               does not recognize other custom words from the model's words resource.
               **Beta:** The parameter is beta functionality.
               See [Using a grammar for speech
               recognition](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-grammarUse).
        :param bool redaction: (optional) If `true`, the service redacts, or masks,
               numeric data from final transcripts. The feature redacts any number that
               has three or more consecutive digits by replacing each digit with an `X`
               character. It is intended to redact sensitive numeric data, such as credit
               card numbers. By default, the service performs no redaction.
               When you enable redaction, the service automatically enables smart
               formatting, regardless of whether you explicitly disable that feature. To
               ensure maximum security, the service also disables keyword spotting
               (ignores the `keywords` and `keywords_threshold` parameters) and returns
               only a single final transcript (forces the `max_alternatives` parameter to
               be `1`).
               **Beta:** The parameter is beta functionality. Applies to US English,
               Japanese, and Korean transcription only.
               See [Numeric
               redaction](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-formatting#numeric-redaction).
        :param bool processing_metrics: (optional) If `true`, requests processing
               metrics about the service's transcription of the input audio. The service
               returns processing metrics at the interval specified by the
               `processing_metrics_interval` parameter. It also returns processing metrics
               for transcription events, for example, for final and interim results. By
               default, the service returns no processing metrics.
               See [Processing
               metrics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-metrics#processing-metrics).
        :param float processing_metrics_interval: (optional) Specifies the interval
               in real wall-clock seconds at which the service is to return processing
               metrics. The parameter is ignored unless the `processing_metrics` parameter
               is set to `true`.
               The parameter accepts a minimum value of 0.1 seconds. The level of
               precision is not restricted, so you can specify values such as 0.25 and
               0.125.
               The service does not impose a maximum value. If you want to receive
               processing metrics only for transcription events instead of at periodic
               intervals, set the value to a large number. If the value is larger than the
               duration of the audio, the service returns processing metrics only for
               transcription events.
               See [Processing
               metrics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-metrics#processing-metrics).
        :param bool audio_metrics: (optional) If `true`, requests detailed
               information about the signal characteristics of the input audio. The
               service returns audio metrics with the final transcription results. By
               default, the service returns no audio metrics.
               See [Audio
               metrics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-metrics#audio-metrics).
        :param float end_of_phrase_silence_time: (optional) If `true`, specifies
               the duration of the pause interval at which the service splits a transcript
               into multiple final results. If the service detects pauses or extended
               silence before it reaches the end of the audio stream, its response can
               include multiple final results. Silence indicates a point at which the
               speaker pauses between spoken words or phrases.
               Specify a value for the pause interval in the range of 0.0 to 120.0.
               * A value greater than 0 specifies the interval that the service is to use
               for speech recognition.
               * A value of 0 indicates that the service is to use the default interval.
               It is equivalent to omitting the parameter.
               The default pause interval for most languages is 0.8 seconds; the default
               for Chinese is 0.6 seconds.
               See [End of phrase silence
               time](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-parsing#silence-time).
        :param bool split_transcript_at_phrase_end: (optional) If `true`, directs
               the service to split the transcript into multiple final results based on
               semantic features of the input, for example, at the conclusion of
               meaningful phrases such as sentences. The service bases its understanding
               of semantic features on the base language model that you use with a
               request. Custom language models and grammars can also influence how and
               where the service splits a transcript. By default, the service splits
               transcripts based solely on the pause interval.
               See [Split transcript at phrase
               end](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-parsing#split-transcript).
        :param float speech_detector_sensitivity: (optional) The sensitivity of
               speech activity detection that the service is to perform. Use the parameter
               to suppress word insertions from music, coughing, and other non-speech
               events. The service biases the audio it passes for speech recognition by
               evaluating the input audio against prior models of speech and non-speech
               activity.
               Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0:
               * 0.0 suppresses all audio (no speech is transcribed).
               * 0.5 (the default) provides a reasonable compromise for the level of
               sensitivity.
               * 1.0 suppresses no audio (speech detection sensitivity is disabled).
               The values increase on a monotonic curve. See [Speech detector
               sensitivity](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-detection#detection-parameters-sensitivity).
        :param float background_audio_suppression: (optional) The level to which
               the service is to suppress background audio based on its volume to prevent
               it from being transcribed as speech. Use the parameter to suppress side
               conversations or background noise.
               Specify a value in the range of 0.0 to 1.0:
               * 0.0 (the default) provides no suppression (background audio suppression
               is disabled).
               * 0.5 provides a reasonable level of audio suppression for general usage.
               * 1.0 suppresses all audio (no audio is transcribed).
               The values increase on a monotonic curve. See [Background audio
               suppression](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-detection#detection-parameters-suppression).
        :param bool low_latency: (optional) If `true` for next-generation
               `Multimedia` and `Telephony` models that support low latency, directs the
               service to produce results even more quickly than it usually does.
               Next-generation models produce transcription results faster than
               previous-generation models. The `low_latency` parameter causes the models
               to produce results even more quickly, though the results might be less
               accurate when the parameter is used.
               The parameter is not available for previous-generation `Broadband` and
               `Narrowband` models. It is available only for some next-generation models.
               For a list of next-generation models that support low latency, see
               [Supported next-generation language
               models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-models-ng#models-ng-supported).
               * For more information about the `low_latency` parameter, see [Low
               latency](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-interim#low-latency).

               is to be used with the custom language model. For most languages, the
               dialect matches the language of the base model by default. For example,
               `en-US` is used for the US English language models. All dialect values are
               case-insensitive.
               The parameter is meaningful only for Spanish language models, for which you
               can always safely omit the parameter to have the service create the correct
               mapping. For Spanish, the service creates a custom language model that is
               suited for speech in one of the following dialects:
               * `es-ES` for Castilian Spanish (`es-ES` models)
               * `es-LA` for Latin American Spanish (`es-AR`, `es-CL`, `es-CO`, and
               `es-PE` models)
               * `es-US` for Mexican (North American) Spanish (`es-MX` models)
               If you specify the `dialect` parameter for a non-Spanish language model,
               its value must match the language of the base model. If you specify the
               `dialect` for a Spanish language model, its value must match one of the
               defined mappings (`es-ES`, `es-LA`, or `es-MX`).

        Train a custom language model.

        Initiates the training of a custom language model with new resources such as
        corpora, grammars, and custom words. After adding, modifying, or deleting
        resources for a custom language model, use this method to begin the actual

        with words that were added or modified by the user directly. You must use
        credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to train it.
        The training method is asynchronous. It can take on the order of minutes to
        complete depending on the amount of data on which the service is being trained and
        the current load on the service. The method returns an HTTP 200 response code to
        indicate that the training process has begun.
        You can monitor the status of the training by using the [Get a custom language
        model](#getlanguagemodel) method to poll the model's status. Use a loop to check
        the status every 10 seconds. The method returns a `LanguageModel` object that
        includes `status` and `progress` fields. A status of `available` means that the

        ### Training failures
         Training can fail to start for the following reasons:
        * The service is currently handling another request for the custom model, such as
        another training request or a request to add a corpus or grammar to the model.
        * No training data have been added to the custom model.
        * The custom model contains one or more invalid corpora, grammars, or words (for
        example, a custom word has an invalid sounds-like pronunciation). You can correct
        the invalid resources or set the `strict` parameter to `false` to exclude the
        invalid resources from the training. The model must contain at least one valid
        resource for training to succeed.

        :param str customization_id: The customization ID (GUID) of the custom
               language model that is to be used for the request. You must make the
               request with credentials for the instance of the service that owns the
               custom model.
        :param str word_type_to_add: (optional) _For custom models that are based
               on previous-generation models_, the type of words from the custom language
               model's words resource on which to train the model:
               * `all` (the default) trains the model on all new words, regardless of
               whether they were extracted from corpora or grammars or were added or
               modified by the user.
               * `user` trains the model only on custom words that were added or modified
               by the user directly. The model is not trained on new words extracted from
               corpora or grammars.
               _For custom models that are based on next-generation models_, the service
               ignores the parameter. The words resource contains only custom words that
               the user adds or modifies directly, so the parameter is unnecessary.
        :param float customization_weight: (optional) Specifies a customization
               weight for the custom language model. The customization weight tells the
               service how much weight to give to words from the custom language model
               compared to those from the base model for speech recognition. Specify a
               value between 0.0 and 1.0; the default is 0.3.
               The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher
               value if your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model.
               Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the
               accuracy of phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively
               affect performance on non-domain phrases.
               The value that you assign is used for all recognition requests that use the
               model. You can override it for any recognition request by specifying a
               customization weight for that request.
               See [Using customization
               weight](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-languageUse#weight).

        Add a corpus.

        Adds a single corpus text file of new training data to a custom language model.
        Use multiple requests to submit multiple corpus text files. You must use
        credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add a corpus to
        it. Adding a corpus does not affect the custom language model until you train the
        model for the new data by using the [Train a custom language
        model](#trainlanguagemodel) method.
        Submit a plain text file that contains sample sentences from the domain of
        interest to enable the service to parse the words in context. The more sentences
        you add that represent the context in which speakers use words from the domain,
        the better the service's recognition accuracy.
        The call returns an HTTP 201 response code if the corpus is valid. The service
        then asynchronously processes and automatically extracts data from the contents of
        the corpus. This operation can take on the order of minutes to complete depending
        on the current load on the service, the total number of words in the corpus, and,
        _for custom models that are based on previous-generation models_, the number of
        new (out-of-vocabulary) words in the corpus. You cannot submit requests to add
        additional resources to the custom model or to train the model until the service's
        analysis of the corpus for the current request completes. Use the [Get a
        corpus](#getcorpus) method to check the status of the analysis.
        _For custom models that are based on previous-generation models_, the service
        auto-populates the model's words resource with words from the corpus that are not
        found in its base vocabulary. These words are referred to as out-of-vocabulary
        (OOV) words. After adding a corpus, you must validate the words resource to ensure
        that each OOV word's definition is complete and valid. You can use the [List
        custom words](#listwords) method to examine the words resource. You can use other
        words method to eliminate typos and modify how words are pronounced as needed.
        To add a corpus file that has the same name as an existing corpus, set the
        `allow_overwrite` parameter to `true`; otherwise, the request fails. Overwriting
        an existing corpus causes the service to process the corpus text file and extract
        its data anew. _For a custom model that is based on a previous-generation model_,
        the service first removes any OOV words that are associated with the existing
        corpus from the model's words resource unless they were also added by another
        corpus or grammar, or they have been modified in some way with the [Add custom
        words](#addwords) or [Add a custom word](#addword) method.
        The service limits the overall amount of data that you can add to a custom model
        to a maximum of 10 million total words from all sources combined. _For a custom
        model that is based on a previous-generation model_, you can add no more than 90
        thousand custom (OOV) words to a model. This includes words that the service
        extracts from corpora and grammars, and words that you add directly.

               * Include a maximum of 128 characters in the name.
               * Do not use characters that need to be URL-encoded. For example, do not
               use spaces, slashes, backslashes, colons, ampersands, double quotes, plus
               signs, equals signs, questions marks, and so on in the name. (The service
               does not prevent the use of these characters. But because they must be
               URL-encoded wherever used, their use is strongly discouraged.)
               * Do not use the name of an existing corpus or grammar that is already
               defined for the custom model.
               * Do not use the name `user`, which is reserved by the service to denote
               custom words that are added or modified by the user.
               * Do not use the name `base_lm` or `default_lm`. Both names are reserved

               data for the corpus. Encode the file in UTF-8 if it contains non-ASCII

               characters.
               Make sure that you know the character encoding of the file. You must use
               that same encoding when working with the words in the custom language
               model. For more information, see [Character encoding for custom
               words](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-manageWords#charEncoding).

        Add custom words.

        Adds one or more custom words to a custom language model. You can use this method
        to add words or to modify existing words in a custom model's words resource. _For
        custom models that are based on previous-generation models_, the service populates
        the words resource for a custom model with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from each
        corpus or grammar that is added to the model. You can use this method to modify
        OOV words in the model's words resource.
        _For a custom model that is based on a previous-generation model_, the words
        resource for a model can contain a maximum of 90 thousand custom (OOV) words. This
        includes words that the service extracts from corpora and grammars and words that
        you add directly.
        You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add
        or modify custom words for the model. Adding or modifying custom words does not
        affect the custom model until you train the model for the new data by using the
        [Train a custom language model](#trainlanguagemodel) method.
        You add custom words by providing a `CustomWords` object, which is an array of
        `CustomWord` objects, one per word. Use the object's `word` parameter to identify
        the word that is to be added. You can also provide one or both of the optional
        `display_as` or `sounds_like` fields for each word.
        * The `display_as` field provides a different way of spelling the word in a
        transcript. Use the parameter when you want the word to appear different from its
        usual representation or from its spelling in training data. For example, you might
        indicate that the word `IBM` is to be displayed as `IBM&trade;`.
        * The `sounds_like` field, _which can be used only with a custom model that is
        based on a previous-generation model_, provides an array of one or more
        pronunciations for the word. Use the parameter to specify how the word can be
        pronounced by users. Use the parameter for words that are difficult to pronounce,
        foreign words, acronyms, and so on. For example, you might specify that the word
        `IEEE` can sound like `i triple e`. You can specify a maximum of five sounds-like
        pronunciations for a word. If you omit the `sounds_like` field, the service
        attempts to set the field to its pronunciation of the word. It cannot generate a
        pronunciation for all words, so you must review the word's definition to ensure
        that it is complete and valid.
        If you add a custom word that already exists in the words resource for the custom
        model, the new definition overwrites the existing data for the word. If the
        service encounters an error with the input data, it returns a failure code and
        does not add any of the words to the words resource.
        The call returns an HTTP 201 response code if the input data is valid. It then
        asynchronously processes the words to add them to the model's words resource. The
        time that it takes for the analysis to complete depends on the number of new words
        that you add but is generally faster than adding a corpus or grammar.
        You can monitor the status of the request by using the [Get a custom language
        model](#getlanguagemodel) method to poll the model's status. Use a loop to check
        the status every 10 seconds. The method returns a `Customization` object that
        includes a `status` field. A status of `ready` means that the words have been
        added to the custom model. The service cannot accept requests to add new data or
        to train the model until the existing request completes.
        You can use the [List custom words](#listwords) or [Get a custom word](#getword)
        method to review the words that you add. Words with an invalid `sounds_like` field
        include an `error` field that describes the problem. You can use other
        words-related methods to correct errors, eliminate typos, and modify how words are
        pronounced as needed.

        Add a grammar.

        Adds a single grammar file to a custom language model. Submit a plain text file in
        UTF-8 format that defines the grammar. Use multiple requests to submit multiple
        grammar files. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns
        a model to add a grammar to it. Adding a grammar does not affect the custom
        language model until you train the model for the new data by using the [Train a
        custom language model](#trainlanguagemodel) method.
        The call returns an HTTP 201 response code if the grammar is valid. The service
        then asynchronously processes the contents of the grammar and automatically
        extracts new words that it finds. This operation can take a few seconds or minutes
        to complete depending on the size and complexity of the grammar, as well as the
        current load on the service. You cannot submit requests to add additional
        resources to the custom model or to train the model until the service's analysis
        of the grammar for the current request completes. Use the [Get a
        grammar](#getgrammar) method to check the status of the analysis.
        The service populates the model's words resource with any word that is recognized
        by the grammar that is not found in the model's base vocabulary. These are
        referred to as out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. You can use the [List custom
        words](#listwords) method to examine the words resource and use other
        words-related methods to eliminate typos and modify how words are pronounced as
        needed.
        To add a grammar that has the same name as an existing grammar, set the
        `allow_overwrite` parameter to `true`; otherwise, the request fails. Overwriting
        an existing grammar causes the service to process the grammar file and extract OOV
        words anew. Before doing so, it removes any OOV words associated with the existing
        grammar from the model's words resource unless they were also added by another
        resource or they have been modified in some way with the [Add custom
        words](#addwords) or [Add a custom word](#addword) method.
        The service limits the overall amount of data that you can add to a custom model
        to a maximum of 10 million total words from all sources combined. Also, you can
        add no more than 90 thousand OOV words to a model. This includes words that the
        service extracts from corpora and grammars and words that you add directly.
        Grammars are available for all languages and models that support language
        customization.
        **Note:** Grammars are supported only for use with previous-generation models.

               language model that is to be used for the request. You must make the

               custom model.
        :param str grammar_name: The name of the new grammar for the custom
               language model. Use a localized name that matches the language of the
               custom model and reflects the contents of the grammar.
               * Include a maximum of 128 characters in the name.
               * Do not use characters that need to be URL-encoded. For example, do not
               use spaces, slashes, backslashes, colons, ampersands, double quotes, plus
               signs, equals signs, questions marks, and so on in the name. (The service
               does not prevent the use of these characters. But because they must be
               URL-encoded wherever used, their use is strongly discouraged.)
               * Do not use the name of an existing grammar or corpus that is already
               defined for the custom model.
               * Do not use the name `user`, which is reserved by the service to denote
               custom words that are added or modified by the user.
               * Do not use the name `base_lm` or `default_lm`. Both names are reserved

        :param str grammar_file: A plain text file that contains the grammar in the
               format specified by the `Content-Type` header. Encode the file in UTF-8
               (ASCII is a subset of UTF-8). Using any other encoding can lead to issues
               when compiling the grammar or to unexpected results in decoding. The
               service ignores an encoding that is specified in the header of the grammar.
               With the `curl` command, use the `--data-binary` option to upload the file
               for the request.
        :param str content_type: The format (MIME type) of the grammar file:
               * `application/srgs` for Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF), which uses a
               plain-text representation that is similar to traditional BNF grammars.

        Train a custom acoustic model.

        Initiates the training of a custom acoustic model with new or changed audio
        resources. After adding or deleting audio resources for a custom acoustic model,
        use this method to begin the actual training of the model on the latest audio
        data. The custom acoustic model does not reflect its changed data until you train
        it. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to
        train it.
        The training method is asynchronous. Training time depends on the cumulative
        amount of audio data that the custom acoustic model contains and the current load
        on the service. When you train or retrain a model, the service uses all of the
        model's audio data in the training. Training a custom acoustic model takes
        approximately as long as the length of its cumulative audio data. For example, it
        takes approximately 2 hours to train a model that contains a total of 2 hours of
        audio. The method returns an HTTP 200 response code to indicate that the training
        process has begun.
        You can monitor the status of the training by using the [Get a custom acoustic
        model](#getacousticmodel) method to poll the model's status. Use a loop to check
        the status once a minute. The method returns an `AcousticModel` object that
        includes `status` and `progress` fields. A status of `available` indicates that
        the custom model is trained and ready to use. The service cannot train a model
        while it is handling another request for the model. The service cannot accept
        subsequent training requests, or requests to add new audio resources, until the
        existing training request completes.
        You can use the optional `custom_language_model_id` parameter to specify the GUID
        of a separately created custom language model that is to be used during training.
        Train with a custom language model if you have verbatim transcriptions of the
        audio files that you have added to the custom model or you have either corpora
        (text files) or a list of words that are relevant to the contents of the audio
        files. For training to succeed, both of the custom models must be based on the
        same version of the same base model, and the custom language model must be fully
        trained and available.
        **Note:** Acoustic model customization is supported only for use with
        previous-generation models. It is not supported for next-generation models.

        ### Training failures
         Training can fail to start for the following reasons:
        * The service is currently handling another request for the custom model, such as
        another training request or a request to add audio resources to the model.
        * The custom model contains less than 10 minutes or more than 200 hours of audio
        data.
        * You passed a custom language model with the `custom_language_model_id` query
        parameter that is not in the available state. A custom language model must be
        fully trained and available to be used to train a custom acoustic model.
        * You passed an incompatible custom language model with the
        `custom_language_model_id` query parameter. Both custom models must be based on
        the same version of the same base model.
        * The custom model contains one or more invalid audio resources. You can correct
        the invalid audio resources or set the `strict` parameter to `false` to exclude
        the invalid resources from the training. The model must contain at least one valid
        resource for training to succeed.

        Upgrade a custom acoustic model.

        Initiates the upgrade of a custom acoustic model to the latest version of its base
        language model. The upgrade method is asynchronous. It can take on the order of
        minutes or hours to complete depending on the amount of data in the custom model
        and the current load on the service; typically, upgrade takes approximately twice
        the length of the total audio contained in the custom model. A custom model must
        be in the `ready` or `available` state to be upgraded. You must use credentials

        """
        Add an audio resource.

        Adds an audio resource to a custom acoustic model. Add audio content that reflects
        the acoustic characteristics of the audio that you plan to transcribe. You must
        use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add an audio
        resource to it. Adding audio data does not affect the custom acoustic model until
        you train the model for the new data by using the [Train a custom acoustic
        model](#trainacousticmodel) method.
        You can add individual audio files or an archive file that contains multiple audio
        files. Adding multiple audio files via a single archive file is significantly more
        efficient than adding each file individually. You can add audio resources in any
        format that the service supports for speech recognition.
        You can use this method to add any number of audio resources to a custom model by
        calling the method once for each audio or archive file. You can add multiple
        different audio resources at the same time. You must add a minimum of 10 minutes
        and a maximum of 200 hours of audio that includes speech, not just silence, to a
        custom acoustic model before you can train it. No audio resource, audio- or
        archive-type, can be larger than 100 MB. To add an audio resource that has the
        same name as an existing audio resource, set the `allow_overwrite` parameter to
        `true`; otherwise, the request fails.
        The method is asynchronous. It can take several seconds or minutes to complete
        depending on the duration of the audio and, in the case of an archive file, the
        total number of audio files being processed. The service returns a 201 response
        code if the audio is valid. It then asynchronously analyzes the contents of the
        audio file or files and automatically extracts information about the audio such as
        its length, sampling rate, and encoding. You cannot submit requests to train or
        upgrade the model until the service's analysis of all audio resources for current
        requests completes.
        To determine the status of the service's analysis of the audio, use the [Get an
        audio resource](#getaudio) method to poll the status of the audio. The method
        accepts the customization ID of the custom model and the name of the audio
        resource, and it returns the status of the resource. Use a loop to check the
        status of the audio every few seconds until it becomes `ok`.
        **Note:** Acoustic model customization is supported only for use with
        previous-generation models. It is not supported for next-generation models.
        **See also:** [Add audio to the custom acoustic
        model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-acoustic#addAudio).
        ### Content types for audio-type resources
         You can add an individual audio file in any format that the service supports for
        speech recognition. For an audio-type resource, use the `Content-Type` parameter
        to specify the audio format (MIME type) of the audio file, including specifying
        the sampling rate, channels, and endianness where indicated.
        * `audio/alaw` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/basic` (Use only with narrowband models.)
        * `audio/flac`
        * `audio/g729` (Use only with narrowband models.)
        * `audio/l16` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of
        channels (`channels`) and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/mp3`
        * `audio/mpeg`
        * `audio/mulaw` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
        * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
        * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
        The sampling rate of an audio file must match the sampling rate of the base model
        for the custom model: for broadband models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband
        models, at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is higher than the
        minimum required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate.
        If the sampling rate of the audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the
        service labels the audio file as `invalid`.
         **See also:** [Supported audio
        formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-audio-formats).
        ### Content types for archive-type resources
         You can add an archive file (**.zip** or **.tar.gz** file) that contains audio
        files in any format that the service supports for speech recognition. For an
        archive-type resource, use the `Content-Type` parameter to specify the media type
        of the archive file:
        * `application/zip` for a **.zip** file
        * `application/gzip` for a **.tar.gz** file.
        When you add an archive-type resource, the `Contained-Content-Type` header is
        optional depending on the format of the files that you are adding:
        * For audio files of type `audio/alaw`, `audio/basic`, `audio/l16`, or
        `audio/mulaw`, you must use the `Contained-Content-Type` header to specify the
        format of the contained audio files. Include the `rate`, `channels`, and
        `endianness` parameters where necessary. In this case, all audio files contained
        in the archive file must have the same audio format.
        * For audio files of all other types, you can omit the `Contained-Content-Type`
        header. In this case, the audio files contained in the archive file can have any
        of the formats not listed in the previous bullet. The audio files do not need to
        have the same format.
        Do not use the `Contained-Content-Type` header when adding an audio-type resource.
        ### Naming restrictions for embedded audio files
         The name of an audio file that is contained in an archive-type resource can
        include a maximum of 128 characters. This includes the file extension and all
        elements of the name (for example, slashes).

        :param str customization_id: The customization ID (GUID) of the custom
               acoustic model that is to be used for the request. You must make the
               request with credentials for the instance of the service that owns the
               custom model.
        :param str audio_name: The name of the new audio resource for the custom
               acoustic model. Use a localized name that matches the language of the
               custom model and reflects the contents of the resource.
               * Include a maximum of 128 characters in the name.
               * Do not use characters that need to be URL-encoded. For example, do not
               use spaces, slashes, backslashes, colons, ampersands, double quotes, plus
               signs, equals signs, questions marks, and so on in the name. (The service
               does not prevent the use of these characters. But because they must be
               URL-encoded wherever used, their use is strongly discouraged.)
               * Do not use the name of an audio resource that has already been added to
               the custom model.
        :param BinaryIO audio_resource: The audio resource that is to be added to
               the custom acoustic model, an individual audio file or an archive file.
               With the `curl` command, use the `--data-binary` option to upload the file
               for the request.
        :param str content_type: (optional) For an audio-type resource, the format
               (MIME type) of the audio. For more information, see **Content types for
               audio-type resources** in the method description.
               For an archive-type resource, the media type of the archive file. For more
               information, see **Content types for archive-type resources** in the method
               description.
        :param str contained_content_type: (optional) _For an archive-type
               resource_, specify the format of the audio files that are contained in the
               archive file if they are of type `audio/alaw`, `audio/basic`, `audio/l16`,
               or `audio/mulaw`. Include the `rate`, `channels`, and `endianness`
               parameters where necessary. In this case, all audio files that are
               contained in the archive file must be of the indicated type.
               For all other audio formats, you can omit the header. In this case, the
               audio files can be of multiple types as long as they are not of the types
               listed in the previous paragraph.
               The parameter accepts all of the audio formats that are supported for use
               with speech recognition. For more information, see **Content types for
               audio-type resources** in the method description.
               _For an audio-type resource_, omit the header.
        :param bool allow_overwrite: (optional) If `true`, the specified audio
               resource overwrites an existing audio resource with the same name. If
               `false`, the request fails if an audio resource with the same name already
               exists. The parameter has no effect if an audio resource with the same name
               does not already exist.
